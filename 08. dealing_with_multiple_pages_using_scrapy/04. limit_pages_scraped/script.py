# ==== limit pages scraped ====

# 1. create a max_page variable:
# this sets the maximum amount of pages

# 2. crate a page_count:
# this tracks the current page

# 3. add an if statement to check if the page_count has reached the max_pages:
# this stops scraping if the maximum pages is reached

# 4. add an incrementor to increment the page counter in the if statement for next_page and button_disabled:
# this increments the pages one at a time
